"""
Takes in an RNA sequence and a structural element, and returns a list of
partitions of the sequence. The structural element is one of the constants
defined at the top of this file. The RNA sequence is a list of bases.
This method chooses a length for the sequences to return from a probability
distribution over the lengths of sequences representing the specified
structure, then returns a list of the partitions. The partitions are lists.
The first element in the list is a list of tuples representing the start and
end indices of both halves of the partition (e.g. [(0, 4), (8, 12)]). The second
element is the first half of the partition taken from the beginning of the
sequence, concatenated with a possible end half.
