"""
Uses Nussinov's algorithm to compute the optimal folding for an RNA sequence.

RNA is a list of tuples, where the first element in each tuple is a base
and the second element is the index of that base in the original sequence.
For example, for the sequence AGCU, RNA would be
    [('A', 0), ('G', 1), ('C', 2), ('U', 3)]
This is in order to support folding noncontiguous subsequences. If you have
a complete sequence you would like to fold, you can use the MakeSeq method
to turn the sequence into this format.

Returns a tuple of the score of the optimal folding, and the optimal folding
as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains 2 tuples representing bases
in the same format as the input. If a base is not paired with anything, the
corresponding tuple is (None, None). An example folding for 'CUAC':
    [(('C', 0), (None, None)), (('U', 1), ('A', 2)), (('C', 3), (None, None))]
